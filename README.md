# BananaApp

This project presents an Android-based application designed to classify the ripeness, identify the variety, and determine the shelf-life of Philippine bananas. Leveraging image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the app analyzes banana images to provide users with accurate information regarding their ripeness stage and estimated shelf-life. This tool aims to assist farmers, distributors, and consumers in making informed decisions to reduce waste and optimize the consumption of bananas.

Key Features:

Ripeness Classification: Utilizes image analysis to determine the current ripeness stage of the banana.

Variety Identification: Identifies the specific variety of the banana based on visual characteristics.

Shelf-Life Estimation: Provides an estimated shelf-life to inform users of the optimal consumption period.

Technologies Used:

Android SDK

OpenCV for image processing

Machine learning algorithms for classification

Potential Applications:

Agriculture: Assists farmers in monitoring banana ripeness to determine the best harvest times.

Supply Chain: Enables distributors to manage inventory based on ripeness and shelf-life, reducing waste.

Consumer Use: Helps consumers select bananas at their preferred ripeness and plan consumption accordingly.
