This project presents an **Android-based application** designed to classify the ripeness, identify the variety, and determine the shelf-life of **Philippine bananas**. Leveraging image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the app analyzes banana images to provide users with accurate information regarding their ripeness stage and estimated shelf-life.his tool aims to assist farmers, distributors, and consumers in making informed decisions to reduce waste and optimize the consumption of bananas.

**Key Features:**
- **Ripeness Classification:** utilizes image analysis to determine the current ripeness stage of the banana.
- **Variety Identification:** identifies the specific variety of the banana based on visual characteristics.
- **Shelf-Life Estimation:** provides an estimated shelf-life to inform users of the optimal consumption period.
  
**Technologies Used:**
- Android SDK
- OpenCV for image processing
- Machine learning algorithms for classification

**Potential Applications:**
- **Agriculture:** assists farmers in monitoring banana ripeness to determine the best harvest times.
- **Supply Chain:** enables distributors to manage inventory based on ripeness and shelf-life, reducing waste.
- **Consumer Use:** helps consumers select bananas at their preferred ripeness and plan consumption accordingly.
